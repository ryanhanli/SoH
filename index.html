                                Empirical research answers this question.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A study done in 1972 by Stanford-based psychologist Walter Mischel showcases the capabilities of willpower.  Known as the marshmallow test, Mischel and colleagues presented preschoolers with a plate of marshmallows.  Each child was then offered a choice between a small but immediate reward, or two small rewards if they waited for a period of time.  The child could eat the one and only marshmallow immediately, or wait for the researcher to leave and come back to have the opportunity to eat two marshmallows.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Years later, the research team followed up with these kids and found that the children who waited for the second marshmallow were generally faring better in life scoring higher on tests, making more money, and being more resiliant and confident.

                            <p class="text-intro">
                                We now know why willpower is so important, so let's see how it works.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Let's take a look at another study that was done at Florida State University by Roy Baumesiter and his colleagues.  This study involved the use of cookies and radishes.  Participants were split into two groups in which one group could eat the cookies while the other could only eat the radishes.  Afterwards, the researchers told both groups to do a set of unsolvable math problems.  The results?  The group who got to eat the cookies lasted more than twice as long trying to solve the puzzles.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What does this mean? Willpower is like a muscle.  The more you use it, the weaker it gets, until it's all gone.  The radish eaters depleted their willpower resisting cookies, and didn't have as much willpower to stick with the puzzle as the cookie eaters did.  Almost everything we do requires willpower and as the day progresses our strength is progressively sapped.

                  </h2>
                  When we are depleted of willpower we make bad decisions and are significantly less productive.  Beware of these common willpower vampires: making decisions, low blood sugar, sleep deprivation, multitasking, and restraining impulses.

                    Willpower can be Strengthened
                  </h2>
                  Willpower is like a muscle.  The more one exercises it, the stronger it gets.  However the strain you put on your willpower is important.  If you lift too little weight, there won't be enough strain.  Lift too much and you'll overwhelm yourself.  Try and set realistic goals that your willpower can handle.

                    Rest
                  </h2>
                  Just like a muscle, willpower needs to be rested as well.  To ensure one doesn't succumb to temptations, one should identify the impulses that tempt them the most and ensure they give their willpower enough rest to deal with them.  Thus, try and do productive things earlier in the day when willpower is high.

                  </h2>
                  Fnding yourself falling victim to temptation?  Try closing your eyes, taking twenty breaths and focusing on each cycle.  Doing this in moments of weakness can help one triumph over temptation.  Exercise and sleep also help by optimizing heart rate variability which is a strong indicator of willpower.

                  </h2>
                  When we make it difficult for us to accomplish a task, we are less likely to do it.  Have trouble staying off your phone during moments of studying?  Put the phone in another room.

                    Two Wills Are Better Than One
                  </h2>
                  Social support can be key in boosting willpower.  When we team up with friends, we no longer only hold ourselves accountable for our actions but them as well.  Furthermore, studies show that simply observing people exerting their willpower can raise our own levels.
